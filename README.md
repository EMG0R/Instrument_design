# EMORY LIGHT MUSIC CONTROLLER ASSIGNMENT
 
This is my assignment

## RESOURCES

- [User setup](userSetup.md)
- [User instructions](userControls.md)
- [Development documentation](developmentDocumentation.md)
- [Max patches](maxPatches)


### LEARNING THE PROGRAM
 First off, you should familiarize yourself with the controls one at a time so you understand what each action feels like to use
### RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW
- select a video to use (DPAD LEFT[-] and DPAD RIGHT[+])

- decide how much to mix with camera input with the video input, you could mix them equally or just use 1 (RIGHT TRIGGER + LEFT STICK up/down)

- switch through different types of video oscillators (Y[-] and A[+]) while switching the operation that occurs between the video+camera signal and the video oscillator (DPAD DOWN[-] and DPAD UP[+]). Some combinations won't show any signal so make sure to spam through these quickly to get to a good starting position. If it doesn't move, try the other direction

- it then helps to adjust brightness (RIGHT TRIGGER and LEAN CONTROLLER up/down) and saturation (RIGHT TRIGGER and LEAN CONTROLLER left/right) to complement which oscillator and operation decide on

- the operation and oscillator you decide on have the biggest effect on the signal so it is logical to explore these to find combinations you like

- B turns on kaleidoscope on oscillator and LEAN CONTROLLER changes its offset

- have fun!
