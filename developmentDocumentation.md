## DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION

This "video synth" is built around the idea of maximum functionality with fewest number of controls. The button combinations can be hard to remember but it is the only way to exercise so much control in the type of situation which would only work with a game controler. The biggest goal for this project right now is to ballance this maximum complexity with a digestible interface. More functionality will be added when I find new jitter objects to implement but the focus right now is on accessiblilty. Refer to [User setup](userSetup.md) for setup instructions and [User instructions](userControls.md) for a list of functionality and controls. 

### WHAT WORKS
- Controler was easy to implement as well as button combinations using gate
- LOTS of loadmess objects make it start in a reasonable place
- I think its pretty fun to use and really powerful

### WHAT DOESN'T WORK
- CPU requirement is huge, probably barely works on intel macs and certain windows machines
- Need further color control
- No accelerometer or gyroscope controls right now since didn't work with xbox controler I was using
